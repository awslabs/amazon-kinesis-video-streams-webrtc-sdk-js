## What is Amazon Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC?

Amazon Kinesis Video Streams provides a standards-compliant WebRTC implementation as a fully managed capability. You can use Amazon Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC to securely live stream media or perform two-way audio or video interaction between any camera IoT device and WebRTC-compliant mobile or web players. As a fully managed capability, you don't have to build, operate, or scale any WebRTC-related cloud infrastructure, such as signaling or media relay servers to securely stream media across applications and devices.

For more information about Amazon Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC, check out the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams-webrtc-dg/latest/devguide/what-is-kvswebrtc.html).

This SDK is intended to be used along side the [AWS SDK for JS](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js) (version 2.585.0+) to interface with the Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Signaling Service for WebRTC streaming.

Note: If you are looking to stream media from a Kinesis Video _Stream_ (different from a Kinesis Video Streams _Signaling Channel_), check out the [Kinesis Video Streams web media viewer](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-viewer).

## Installing
#### In the Browser
To use the SDK in the browser, simply add the following script tag to your HTML pages:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc/dist/kvs-webrtc.min.js"></script>
```

The SDK classes are made available in the global window under the `KVSWebRTC` namespace. For example, `window.KVSWebRTC.SignalingClient`.

The SDK is also compatible with bundlers like Webpack. Follow the instructions in the next section to install the NodeJS module version for use with your bundler.

#### In NodeJS
The preferred way to install the SDK for NodeJS is to use the npm package manager. Simply type the following into a terminal window:

```bash
npm install amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc
```

The SDK classes can then be imported like typical NodeJS modules:
```js
// JavaScript
const SignalingClient = require('amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc').SignalingClient;

// TypeScript / ES6 supported
import { SignalingClient } from 'amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc';
```

## Getting Started
You can start by trying out the SDK with a webcam on the example [WebRTC test page](https://awslabs.github.io/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js/examples/index.html).

It is also recommended to develop familiarity with the WebRTC protocols and KVS Signaling Channel APIs. See the following resources:
* [KVS WebRTC Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams-webrtc-dg/latest/devguide/what-is-kvswebrtc.html)
* [KVS API Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_Operations.html)

The first step in using the SDK in your own application is to follow the [Installing](#installing) instructions above to install the SDK.

From there, see the [Usage](#usage) section below for guidance on using the SDK to build a WebRTC application.
Also refer to the [`examples`](examples) directory for examples on how to write an end-to-end WebRTC application that uses the SDK.

## Usage
This section demonstrates how to use this SDK along with the [AWS SDK for JS](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js) (version 2.585.0+) to build a web-based viewer application.
Refer to the [`examples`](examples) directory for an example of a complete application including both a master and viewer role.

#### Viewer Example With Audio/Video From Local Webcam
These code snippets demonstrate how to build a viewer application that receives audio and video and also sends audio and video from a webcam back to the master.

##### Set Up Variables
```js
// DescribeSignalingChannel API can also be used to get the ARN from a channel name.
const channelARN = 'arn:aws:kinesisvideo:us-west-2:123456789012:channel/test-channel/1234567890';

// AWS Credentials
const accessKeyId = 'ACCESS_KEY_ID_GOES_HERE';
const secretAccessKey = 'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_GOES_HERE';

// <video> HTML elements to use to display the local webcam stream and remote stream from the master
const localView = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0];
const remoteView = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[1];

const region = 'us-west-2';
const clientId = 'RANDOM_VALUE';
```

See [Managing Credentials](#Managing-Credentials) for more information about managing credentials in a web environment.

##### Create KVS Client
```js
const kinesisVideoClient = new AWS.KinesisVideo({
    region,
    accessKeyId,
    secretAccessKey,
    correctClockSkew: true,
});
```

##### Get Signaling Channel Endpoints
Each signaling channel is assigned an HTTPS and WSS endpoint to connect to for data-plane operations. These can be discovered using the `GetSignalingChannelEndpoint` API.
```js
const getSignalingChannelEndpointResponse = await kinesisVideoClient
    .getSignalingChannelEndpoint({
        ChannelARN: channelARN,
        SingleMasterChannelEndpointConfiguration: {
            Protocols: ['WSS', 'HTTPS'],
            Role: KVSWebRTC.Role.VIEWER,
        },
    })
    .promise();
const endpointsByProtocol = getSignalingChannelEndpointResponse.ResourceEndpointList.reduce((endpoints, endpoint) => {
    endpoints[endpoint.Protocol] = endpoint.ResourceEndpoint;
    return endpoints;
}, {});
```

##### Create KVS Signaling Client
The HTTPS endpoint from the `GetSignalingChannelEndpoint` response is used with this client. This client is just used for getting ICE servers, not for actual signaling.
```js
const kinesisVideoSignalingChannelsClient = new AWS.KinesisVideoSignalingChannels({
    region,
    accessKeyId,
    secretAccessKey,
    endpoint: endpointsByProtocol.HTTPS,
    correctClockSkew: true,
});
```

##### Get ICE server configuration
For best performance, we collect STUN and TURN ICE server configurations. The KVS STUN endpoint is always `stun:stun.kinesisvideo.${region}.amazonaws.com:443`.
To get TURN servers, the `GetIceServerConfig` API is used.
```js
const getIceServerConfigResponse = await kinesisVideoSignalingChannelsClient
    .getIceServerConfig({
        ChannelARN: channelARN,
    })
    .promise();
const iceServers = [
    { urls: `stun:stun.kinesisvideo.${region}.amazonaws.com:443` }
];
getIceServerConfigResponse.IceServerList.forEach(iceServer =>
    iceServers.push({
        urls: iceServer.Uris,
        username: iceServer.Username,
        credential: iceServer.Password,
    }),
);
```

##### Create RTCPeerConnection
The [RTCPeerConnection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) is the primary interface for WebRTC communications in the Web.
```js
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({ iceServers });
```

##### Create WebRTC Signaling Client
This is the actual client that is used to send messages over the signaling channel.
```js
signalingClient = new KVSWebRTC.SignalingClient({
    channelARN,
    channelEndpoint: endpointsByProtocol.WSS,
    clientId,
    role: KVSWebRTC.Role.VIEWER,
    region,
    credentials: {
        accessKeyId,
        secretAccessKey,
    },
    systemClockOffset: kinesisVideoClient.config.systemClockOffset,
});
```
##### Add Signaling Client Event Listeners
```js
// Once the signaling channel connection is open, connect to the webcam and create an offer to send to the master
signalingClient.on('open', async () => {
    // Get a stream from the webcam, add it to the peer connection, and display it in the local view
    try {
        const localStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
            video: { width: { ideal: 1280 }, height: { ideal: 720 } },
            audio: true,
        });
        localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream));
        localView.srcObject = localStream;
    } catch (e) {
        // Could not find webcam
        return;
    }

    // Create an SDP offer and send it to the master
    // If there is no concern about browser compatibility, using `addTransceiver` would be better
    const offer = await viewer.peerConnection.createOffer({
        offerToReceiveAudio: true,
        offerToReceiveVideo: true,
    });
    await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);
    signalingClient.sendSdpOffer(viewer.peerConnection.localDescription);
});

// When the SDP answer is received back from the master, add it to the peer connection.
signalingClient.on('sdpAnswer', async answer => {
    await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(answer);
});

// When an ICE candidate is received from the master, add it to the peer connection.
signalingClient.on('iceCandidate', candidate => {
    peerConnection.addIceCandidate(candidate);
});

signalingClient.on('close', () => {
    // Handle client closures
});

signalingClient.on('error', error => {
    // Handle client errors
});

```

##### Add Peer Connection Event Listeners
```js
// Send any ICE candidates generated by the peer connection to the other peer
peerConnection.addEventListener('icecandidate', ({ candidate }) => {
    if (candidate) {
        signalingClient.sendIceCandidate(candidate);
    } else {
        // No more ICE candidates will be generated
    }
});

// As remote tracks are received, add them to the remote view
peerConnection.addEventListener('track', event => {
    if (remoteView.srcObject) {
        return;
    }
    remoteView.srcObject = event.streams[0];
});
```

##### Open Signaling Connection
```
signalingClient.open();
```

### Class: `SigV4RequestSigner`
This class is used to SigV4 sign requests to the signaling service. It implements `RequestSigner`.

This signer is unique from the signers included in the AWS SDK for JS because it supports signing WebSocket requests.

This is a useful class to use in a NodeJS backend to sign requests and send them back to a client so that the client does not need
to have AWS credentials.

Implementation of interface method.
* Uses the SigV4 signing mechanism.
* Supports credentials with and without a session token.
* Only supports the `wss://` protocol.
* Does not support specifying an expiration.

If the signer's credentials support refreshing, they will be be refreshed if necessary before signing.

### Enum: `Role`
An enum with the following values:
* `MASTER`
* `VIEWER`

## Compatibility

The SDK is supported in the following browsers / environments:

| Chrome | Edge | Firefox | IE  | Safari | Android Webview | Android Chrome | iOS Safari | NodeJS |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | --- | ------ | --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 52     | 12   | 36      | No  | 11     | 53              | 52             | 11         | 8      |

To increase WebRTC API compatibility between different browsers, it's highly recommended to use [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtcHacks/adapter).

Following is a quote from [adapter.js docs](https://github.com/webrtcHacks/adapter):

> adapter.js is a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences in WebRTC.
  The prefix differences are mostly gone these days but differences in behaviour between browsers remain.

## Managing Credentials
The `SignalingClient` requires a SigV4 signed URL in order to make requests to the KVS signaling service backend.
The client can either be provided with AWS credentials (and then it will use those to sign requests) or it can be
provided with a custom `RequestSigner` that can perform the request signing.

There are several mechanisms that are recommended for managing AWS credentials in a web client, such as using Cognito or Federated Identities, that are explained
in the [AWS SDK for JS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-browser.html).

Alternatively, if you do not want any AWS credentials in the web client, you can provide a request signer that makes a call to your own backend
that uses AWS credentials to create a signed request for the KVS WebRTC Signaling Service. With a NodeJS based backend, you can create signed requests using the `SigV4RequestSigner` class.
Note that you will also have to get other data, such as the ICE server config, on the backend and send that to the client.

### IAM Permissions
Regardless of the mechanism used to manage the credentials, the credentials will need to have permissions to perform KVS operations. The following is an example policy for a viewer of a particular channel:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "kvsViewerPolicy",
      "Action": [
        "kinesisvideo:ConnectAsViewer", // Use "kinesisvideo:ConnectAsMaster" for master policy instead.
        "kinesisvideo:DescribeSignalingChannel",
        "kinesisvideo:GetIceServerConfig",
        "kinesisvideo:GetSignalingChannelEndpoint"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesisvideo:<region>:<account_ID>:channel/<channelName>/<creationTime>"
    }
  ]
}
```

See [KVS WebRTC Access Control Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams-webrtc-dg/latest/devguide/kvswebrtc-how-iam.html) for more information.

## Development

#### Running WebRTC Test Page Locally
The SDK and test page can be edited and run locally by following these instructions:

NodeJS version 16+ is required.

1. Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
1. Run `npm run develop` to run the webserver.
1. Open the WebRTC test page at `http://localhost:3001`

You will need to provide an AWS region, AWS credentials, and a Channel Name.

The source code for the test page is in the [`examples`](examples) directory.

For advanced debugging, use the `WebRTC Internals` tool your browser provides.
